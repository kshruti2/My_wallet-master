# `my_wallet`

Welcome to the `my_wallet` project! This project is a secure token wallet developed for the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain. It supports basic functionalities such as sending and receiving IRCRC2 tokens and displays token balances.

## Project Overview

The `my_wallet` project includes:
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed in Rust for managing token transactions.
- **Frontend**: A web interface for interacting with the wallet.

The project uses the ICP blockchain and adheres to the IRCRC2 token standard.

## Features

- **Create Tokens**: Initialize tokens with an owner and balance.
- **Transfer Tokens**: Send tokens to other addresses.
- **Fetch Balance**: Display the current balance of a wallet.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install [dfx](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove.html) and ensure Rust is installed.
2. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed for the frontend.

### Building and Deploying

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhunuak47/My_wallet.git
   cd my_wallet
   ```

2. **Build and Deploy Backend**

   Navigate to the backend directory and build the smart contract:

   ```bash
   cd my_wallet_backend
   cargo build
   ```

   Deploy the contract to the local ICP testnet:

   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   dfx deploy
   ```

3. **Setup Frontend**

   Navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the application:

   ```bash
   cd my_wallet_frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`, and it proxies API requests to the backend running at port 4943.

### Note on Frontend Environment Variables

If you are hosting the frontend code elsewhere, ensure you adjust environment variables as follows:
- Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack.
- Replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in autogenerated declarations if needed.
- Configure `dfx.json` to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with a string in the autogenerated declarations.
- Write your own `createActor` constructor if necessary.

## Running the Project Locally

To test your project locally, use the following commands:

```bash
# Start the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploy canisters to the replica and generate candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once deployed, your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={your_canister_id}`.

## Testing

Write unit tests for your smart contract in `my_wallet_backend/tests`. You can run tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```
